QNC HW3: Binomial Distribution
    % In a given trial, the probability that x quanta will be released (px) 
    % is given by the binomial term, substitute x for k.

% EXERCISE 1:
% Assume that there are 10 quanta available in a nerve terminal, and 
% for a given release event each is released with a probability of 0.2. 
% For one such event, what is the probability that 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 
% 7, 8, 9, or 10 quanta will be released?

    % Use the binomial probability equation: 
    % P(X = k) = C(n, k) * (p^k) * (q^(n - k))

    % n = total # of quanta available = 10
    % k = number of quanta released = range 0-10
    % The probability of success (p) (releasing one quantum) for each trial is
    % given as 0.2
    % The probability of failure (q) (not releasing one quantum) for each trial 
    % is 1 - p = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8

    % P(X = k) is the probability of getting exactly "k" quanta released
    % C(n, k) is the binomial coefficient, representing the # of ways to choose
    % "k" successes from "n" trials
    % p is the probability of success
    % q is the probability of failure

% Calculate the probability for each value of "k", each possible outcome. 
    % These probabilities should sum up to equal 1.

n = 10
k = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
p = 0.2
q = 1 - p

% Compute binomial coefficient for each value of k
    % C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!)

bcoef = (factorial(n)) ./ ((factorial(k)) .* (factorial(n-k))) 

% Now plug in to the binomial probability equation: 
    % P(X = k) = C(n, k) * (p^k) * (q^(n - k))

prob = bcoef .* (p.^k) .* (q.^(n-k))

% Exercise 2:
% A nerve terminal contains 14 quanta available for release. 
% Release probability of these quanta is low, = 0.1 

% To assess whether this value is reasonable, you run an experiment: 
% activate the nerve and measure the number of quanta that are released. 
% The result is 8 quanta.

% What is the probability that you would get this result (8 quanta)
% if the true probability of release really was 0.1?
% What about for each decile of release probability (0.1, 0.2, ... 1.0)?

% Which value of release probability did you determine to be the most
% probable, given your measurement?


    % Use the binomial probability equation: 
    % P(X = k) = C(n, k) * (p^k) * (q^(n - k))

    % n = total # of quanta available = 14
    % k = number of quanta released = 8
    % The probability of success (p) (releasing one quantum) for each trial is
    % given as 0.1 ... 1.0
    % The probability of failure (q) (not releasing one quantum) for each trial 
    % is 1 - p
    
    % P(X = k) is the probability of getting exactly "k" quanta released

% Calculate the binomial probability for each value of "p", each possible 
% release probability.
    % These probabilities are NOT expected to sum up to equal 1 because this is
    % a likelihood function, which describes how the value of conditional
    % probability changes when you hold your data fixed to the values you
    % measured while varying the values of the parameters. The maximum value of
    % this function is called the maximum likelihood.

n_2 = 14
k_2 = 8
p_2 = [0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1]
q_2 = 1 - p_2 

% Calculate the binomial coefficient, C(n, k) to plug into the binomial
% probability equation.
bcoef_2 = (factorial(n_2)) ./ ((factorial(k_2)) .* (factorial(n_2-k_2))) 

% Now plug in to the binomial probability equation
prob_2 = bcoef_2 .* (p_2.^k_2) .* (q_2.^(n_2-k_2))

% The probability of 8 quanta being released when the release
% probability = 
% 0.1 is 0%  
% 0.2 is .2%
% 0.3 is 2%
% 0.4 is 9%
% 0.5 is 18%
% 0.6 is 20%
% 0.7 is 12% 
% 0.8 is 3%
% 0.9 is .1%
% 1.0 is 0%

% The most probable release probability for releasing 8 quanta is 0.6


% Exercise 3:
% You repeat the experiment under identical conditions.
% You measure that 5 quanta were released.
    % Your sample size has now doubled, to two measurements.
    % You want to take both measurements into account when assessing
    % likelihoods of different release probabilities. 
    % To do so: assume the two measurements are independent. Therefore, the
    % total likelihood is simply the product of the likelihoods associated with
    % with each separate measurement. It's also typical to compute the log of
    % each likelihood and take their sum, often more convenient.

% What are the values of the total likelihood and total log-likelihood if
% we assume the true release probability is 0.1?

% Previously calculated that the likelihood of 8 quanta released at 0.1 
% release probability was 0
sample1_likelihood = 0

% Now compute the likelihood for sample 2, 5 quanta released at
% 0.1 release probability using the binomial probability equation
k_3 = 5

% Calculate the binomial coefficient to plug in after
bcoef_3 = (factorial(n_2)) ./ ((factorial(k_3)) .* (factorial(n_2-k_3))) 

% Now plug in to binomial probability equation
prob_3 = bcoef_3 .* (p_2.^k_3) .* (q_2.^(n_2-k_3))

sample2_likelihood = 0.0078

% Now calculate total likelihood by multiplying the two samples'
% likelihoods together
total_likelihood = sample1_likelihood * sample2_likelihood

% Now calculate the total log-likelihood
total_log_likelihood = log10(sample1_likelihood) + log10(sample2_likelihood)



% Compare to values for other possible release probabilities for each
% sample and determine which value of release probability is most likely,
% given the data. 
% Compute the full likelihood and log-likelihood for release probabilities
% deciles 0-1. What is the maximum value?

% Compute full likelihood
full_likelihood = prob_2 .* prob_3

% Compute log-likelihood 
full_log_likelihood = log10(prob_2) + log10(prob_3)

% The maximum value for the full likelihood is .0224 and for full log
% likelihood it is -1.6498

% Compute functions at higher resolution by change release probability
% range from deciles to resolution of .01

step = 0.01
p_3 = 0:step:1
q_3 = 1-p_3

% compute binomial probability for both samples
prob_4 = bcoef_2 .* (p_3.^k_2) .* (q_3.^(n_2-k_2))
prob_5 = bcoef_3 .* (p_3.^k_2) .* (q_3.^(n_2-k_2)) 

% compute product likelihood and log likelihood
likelihood_highres = prob_4 .* prob_5
log_likelihood_highres = log10(prob_4) + log10(prob_5)

% Increase sample size
n_3 = [20, 30, 40, 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000, 5000, 10000] %this didn't work idk why
n50 = 50
n25 = 25
        % Ignore code below, it did not work, kept for troubleshooting
        % later
            % Initialize arrays to store likelihoods for each value of n_3 for sample 1
            likelihood_inc_sample1 = zeros(size(n_3));
            
            % Calculate likelihood for each value of n_3
            for i = 1:length(n_3)
                % Calculate binomial coefficient for sample 1 with n_3 quanta
                bcoef_samp1 = (factorial(n_3)) ./ ((factorial(k_2)) .* (factorial(n_3 - k_2)));
            
                % Calculate likelihood for sample 1 at each p_2 value using element-wise operators
               likelihood_inc_sample1(i) = bcoef_samp1 .* (p_2(i).^k_2) .* (q_2(i).^(n_3 - k_2));
            end

% Calculate binomial coefficient for sample 1 likelihoods at n = 50
    bcoef_samp1_n50 = (factorial(n50)) ./ ((factorial(k_2)) .* (factorial(n50 - k_2)))

    % Calculate likelihood for sample 1 at n = 50
    likelihood_n50 = bcoef_samp1_n50 .* (p_2.^k_2) .* (q_2.^(n50 - k_2))


% Calculate binomial coefficient for sample 1 likelihoods at n = 25
    bcoef_samp1_n25 = (factorial(n25)) ./ ((factorial(k_2)) .* (factorial(n25 - k_2)))

    % Calculate likelihood for sample 1 at n = 25
    likelihood_n25 = bcoef_samp1_n25 .* (p_2.^k_2) .* (q_2.^(n25 - k_2))


% Exercise 4
% You conduct 100 separate experiments and end up with the data defined
% below.
% What is the most likely value of p (p-hat, the maximum likelihood
% estimate of a paramter in the population) given the sample?

% Define observed data
k_values =        [0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]; % Values of k
observed_counts = [0, 0, 3, 10, 19, 26, 16, 16, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]; % Number of instances for each value of k

% Define a range of p values
p_range = 0:0.01:1;

% Initialize variables to store maximum likelihood estimates
best_p_values = zeros(size(k_values));

% Calculate the maximum likelihood estimate for each value of k
for i = 1:length(k_values)
    k = k_values(i);
    counts = observed_counts(i);
    
    % Define a function to calculate the negative log likelihood
    negative_log_likelihood = @(p) -counts * log(binopdf(k, n, p));
    
    % Find the p value that maximizes the likelihood
    best_p = fminbnd(negative_log_likelihood, 0, 1); % Assuming p is between 0 and 1
    best_p_values(i) = best_p;
end

% best_p_values now contains the most likely release probability for each value of k

% Exercise 5
% You have determined that the true release probability is 0.3 and will
% test whether changing the temperature affects release probability.
% You measure 7 quantal events for the same 14 available quanta.
% Compute p-hat.

    % p-hat is the same as the binomial probability/likelihood?
    % Calculate binomial coefficient
    k_4 = 7
    p_4 = 0.3
    q_4 = 1 - p_4
    bcoef_4 = (factorial(n_2)) ./ ((factorial(k_4)) .* (factorial(n_2 - k_4)))
   
    % Plug in and calculate binomial probability
    p_hat = bcoef_4 .* (p_4.^k_4) .* (q_4.^(n_2 - k_4))

% What is the probability that you would have obtained that measurement
% given a null hypothesis of no effect (an unchanged value of the true 
% release probability, its value remained at 0.3 even with temp change)?
disp(p_hat)

% What is the probability that you would have gotten that measurement if
% your null were true?

% Rationale: if p_hat represents the likelihood of 7 quantal events out of
% 14 available quanta when the release probability is 0.3, then this is
% simply the probability of that occurring, it doesn't change with the
% hypothesis?
disp(p_hat)


% I can conclude that temperature had an effect on release probability.

% RATIONALE: The original release probability is 0.3. Temperature is then
% adjusted and quantal events are recorded, in which 7 quantal events were
% measured out of 14 available quanta. The binomial probability equation
% tells us that the likelihood of 7/14 quanta being released when the
% release probability is .3 is very unlikely, only 6.18% likelihood.
% Therefore, it is unlikely that the release probability was 0.3 at the
% time of measurement/after temperature was adjusted. Therefore, because it
% is unlikely that this would occur at 0.3 release probability, we can
% conclude that it IS likely that the release probability was NOT 0.3,
% implying that release probability changed following a temperature change.
